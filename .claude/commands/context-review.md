Review the .context/ folder for accuracy and freshness.

1. Read .context/_overview.md — is it accurate? Update if the project has changed.
2. For each module file in .context/<category>/<module>.md:
   - Read the tracked source files
   - Check if the documentation still matches the code
   - Update descriptions, patterns, and key decisions if they've drifted
   - Add any new source files that aren't tracked yet
   - Remove entries for deleted files
   - Set "lastUpdated" to now for any modules you update
3. Report what you found and changed.

Keep documentation concise. Don't pad with filler.
